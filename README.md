# COA questions:

a) Write a Java or C++ program to generate the information in Columns 2 and 3, starting from the
Decimal values and then automatically generating the Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers shown in
Table Q1 (a). The program created should be interactive and a user can prompt it to give the following
table at once.

b) Write a program (Java or C++) to convert from decimal notation to binary notation for thirty (30)
randomly generated floating-point numbers with at most three decimal points e.g., 123.875. Your result
should give a list of randomly generated numbers, resulting binary notation and remarks column having
exactly or approximately (with at most five (5) decimal points). Table Q1 (b) shows a sample of an
expected results for 11.81 and 21.25 respectively. The program should allow a user to interactively input
values and get the conversions and statement on whether a number is exact or approximate.
